        <div class="about_us_texts">
            <p>In the New Zealand context, because we rely on public funding, it’s doubly complicated for Asian creatives. You could get stuck between a rock and a hard place. For some stories you get ‘Yeah, but how can you make this work for all New Zealanders?’
                Whereas for other stories you may get, ‘Yeah, but what’s Asian about this? We’d like you to use your voice’. As an Asian do you always have to perform your Asianness? Who decides how ‘Asian’ something really is? Or what does ‘all New Zealanders’
                mean? We have a lot of work to do to unpack these ideas.” – Shuchi Kothari, ‘Episode One’ designer and convenor in Medium

            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>Episode One is a high-end development initiative that builds creative and professional capacity within our community of Pan-Asian screen practitioners. Our ambition is to launch sustainable careers for people who have been historically underrepresented
                in Aotearoa New Zealand’s screen industry. This initiative, made possible with the support of Irirangi Te Motu New Zealand On Air and Te Tumu Whakaata Taonga New Zealand Film Commission, has been designed by convenor Shuchi Kothari to
                take six teams with a web series idea through a development and training programme to create a series bible, pitch deck, and finally the production of a high quality pilot.</p>

            <p>This structured course spans four months, including classes and workshops delivered by a range of industry experts. This will be followed by a six to eight-month scaffolded period within which each team produces the pilot episode of their
                web series. Pilots will be shared with the public and screened to industry stakeholders to solicit series production funding. </p>

            <p>This capability-building initiative is geared towards emerging Pan-Asian practitioners who have the potential to develop and deliver a quality web series pilot for a local and/or international audience.</p>

            <p>Six selected teams will receive structured tuition, individual mentoring, up to $15,000 for development expenses, and up to $70,000 for the production of the pilot episode.</p>

            <h2>THE DEVELOPMENT COURSE</h2>
            <p>The course consists of 9 half-days across four months. The syllabus is designed to include various progressive modules that enable participants to work collectively and individually to produce a series bible, episodic breakdown, pitch deck,
                and a pilot screenplay.</p>

                ad-hoc guest lectures by industry experts both from overseas and from within New Zealand.</p>
            <p>Also as part of the development process, each writer, director and producer will be matched with respective mentors for individual mentoring sessions.</p>

            <h2>PROGRAMME DESIGNER & CONVENOR</h2>
            <p>Shuchi Kothari, the designer and convenor of Episode One, is a critically acclaimed screenwriter and producer with an illustrious history of teaching, mentoring, and advocacy. She has written and produced several award-winning projects (Firaaq,
                Apron Strings, Rann, Shit One Carries, Coffee & Allah, Fleeting Beauty, A Thousand Apologies, A Taste of Place) that have screened at over 100 international film festivals including Venice, Cannes, Toronto, BFI, Busan, and Telluride and
                broadcast on national television and Comedy Central.</p>
            <p>Shuchi has extensive mentoring experience both as an academic who has taught screenwriting and film production at the University of Auckland for 25 years and also as an industry consultant and mentor who has guided filmmakers on behalf of
                NZFC, NZOA, Script to Screen, Show Me Shorts, and Outlook for Sunday. Shuchi has served on juries of Film and Television awards, national funding bodies and policy advisory groups.

                brings together immigrant stories by nine Pan-Asian women writers/directors. She is one of six writers selected for Hollywood’s Blacklist programme in 2021. Shuchi’s work often explores themes of inclusion and exclusion, power and privilege,
                with a lightness of touch that keeps the drama buoyant.</p>
